### Roadmap:
* Package/Library Management
* Angular Seed
* Generators
* Yeoman
* Teamwork

## Package Management
- N ode
- P ackage
- M anager

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="../images/background.jpg"-->
## Library/Asset Management
- Bower, Webpack, Yarn, etc...
- NOT Gulp, Grunt, Docker, Heroku - those are deployment management tools

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="../images/background.jpg"-->
## Advanced: Best Practices

- For development, include all libraries in package.json and bower.json
- node_modules should be a level up from the app root
- bower_components should be in the app root
- All package folders should be ephemeral - you can delete and redeploy easily

## Angular Seed

- Starter code for an AngularJS project
- The beginning point at AngularJS.org
